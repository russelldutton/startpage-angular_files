# Homepage

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.4.4.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Dependencies

I believe you will need to open a terminal in `<path_to_project>/startpage-angular_files` and run `npm install` to install all dependencies
